# Kanva

Kanva: **K**nowledge-**A**ware la**N**guage-and-**V**ision **A**ssistant, by the KaLM team.

The quality of instructions is a pivotal element for Instruction-tuned Vision Language Models. We propose a mechanism integrating world knowledge in LLMs to evolve visual instructions to improve the quality of such datasets. Using this mechanism, we construct a dataset evolved from existing public resources.

We show that by applying the dataset on existing model architectures and training recipes, their zero-shot capabilities are significantly improved. After applying the evolved dataset on off-the-shelf language models, our new model series, Kanva, achieve remarkably higher results on MME and MMBench benchmarks compared to the baseline models such as LLaVA.


## Model Architecture

As demonstrated in the figure, we simply adopt the LLaVA model's architecture as well as the training recipe. The models are trained based on public vision-language instructions data, evolved with our rule-based and LLM-based instruction evolution procedure.

## Evaluation

We benchmark two models in the Kanva series, Kanva-14B and Kanva-7B, trained with different language components. The results are reported below.

### MME
Kanva achieved 1666.08 perception score, which was top1 on MME full benchmark on 2023-11-24
